## Research Objective

The thesis evaluates the informational efficiency of decentralized prediction
markets, using Polymarket as the main case and comparing it with traditional
forecast or polling sources where the data are methodologically compatible.

The empirical focus is the 2024 US presidential election. The project asks
whether Polymarket prices are better calibrated, react faster to curated public
events, and whether wallet activity contains dataset-relative early signal
patterns.

## Hypotheses

H1: Brier Score calibration

Polymarket probability forecasts may be better calibrated than comparable
traditional probability forecasts. FiveThirtyEight can be compared when its rows
represent probabilities. RCP cannot be treated as a probability forecast unless
a transformation is documented and tested.

H2: Information integration speed

Polymarket may integrate public information faster than traditional forecast or
polling sources. This requires a curated event catalog and pre-specified event
windows before CAR or reaction-speed analysis.

H3: Wallet-based early signal detection

Large or influential wallets may show lead-lag patterns relative to market price
movements. Any classification must be derived from the observed wallet or trade
distribution. Granger tests can support predictive timing claims, not proof of
true causality.

## Non-Goals

- No agent implementation before deterministic H1, H2, and H3 outputs exist.
- No MCP demo layer before the deterministic core is complete.
- No ML scope yet.
- No causal insider-trading claims.
- No arbitrary whale thresholds.
- No RCP probability comparison without documented transformation.
- No raw table dumps into LLM prompts.

## Deterministic-Core Rule

All statistical calculations are implemented in Python. LLMs may only interpret
precomputed outputs and must not calculate Brier scores, CAR, Granger tests,
wallet classifications, whale scores, or statistical metrics.

## RCP Rule

RCP is treated as a polling signal until a probability transformation is
documented, tested, and explicitly enabled in deterministic code.

Any function that includes RCP in Brier or calibration comparisons must require:

- `include_rcp=True`
- `rcp_transformation_documented=True`

## ML Scope Rule

Machine learning is not in scope yet. Do not add ML models, feature stores,
training pipelines, embeddings, vector databases, or automated classifiers until
the deterministic empirical pipeline is complete and reviewed.

- ml_scope_status: deferred
- ml_reentry_condition: deterministic H1, H2, and H3 outputs exist, pass tests,
  and have written methodology notes.

## Agent And MCP Deferred Rule

Agents and MCP are interpretation and demo layers only. They remain deferred
until deterministic H1, H2, and H3 outputs exist, pass tests, and have written
methodology notes.

## Empirical Baseline Review

Review date: 2026-05-19

Review status: accepted as the first deterministic empirical baseline package.

Reviewed outputs:

- H1 Brier time series: `data/results/h1_brier_scores.csv`
- H1 Diebold-Mariano summary: `data/results/h1_diebold_mariano.json`
- H1 reliability figure: `data/results/h1_reliability_curve.png`
- H2 event-window trace: `data/results/h2_event_window_rows.csv`
- H2 event-window summary: `data/results/h2_event_window_summary.csv`
- H3 wallet distribution inventory:
  `data/results/h3_wallet_distribution_inventory.json`
- H3 wallet tiers: `data/results/h3_wallet_tiers.csv`
- H3 tiered daily activity:
  `data/results/h3_tiered_wallet_activity_daily.csv`
- H3 lead-time histograms: `data/results/h3_lead_time_histograms.csv`
- H3 lead-lag correlations: `data/results/h3_lead_lag_correlations.csv`
- H3 Granger baseline: `data/results/h3_granger_results.csv`

Baseline shape:

- H1 contains 194 overlapping daily observations from 2024-03-01 to
  2024-09-12.
- H2 contains 7 curated events and 2 selected daily windows, for 14 compact
  summary rows.
- H3 contains 4 dataset-relative wallet tiers, 420 lead-time event-tier-day
  rows, 60 lead-time histogram rows, 32 lead-lag correlation rows, and 28
  Granger result rows.

Thesis-ready for the first baseline:

- H1 Brier comparison between Polymarket, FiveThirtyEight, and deterministic
  baselines.
- H2 daily event-window summary table using the curated event seed.
- H3 wallet-tier definition, tier counts, daily activity panel, descriptive
  timing histograms, lead-lag correlations, and Granger baseline result shape.

Needs caution before final thesis conclusions:

- H1 Polymarket and prior-day Polymarket Brier means are nearly identical in
  the current output, so H1 should not be framed as a reaction-speed result.
- RCP remains excluded from probability comparisons until a documented
  transformation exists.
- H2 uses daily windows only and cannot support intraday reaction-speed claims.
- H3 uses a BUY-only observed activity extract and daily alignment.
- H3 Granger results require multiple-testing and sensitivity discussion before
  strong conclusion wording.

Persistence decision:

- H2 compact summaries are already persisted into `analysis_summaries`.
- Full H2 and H3 row-level traces remain file-based.
- Compact H3 summaries should not be persisted until the exact summary payload
  is specified and tested.

Approved thesis wording:

- Use `deterministic baseline`, `daily event-window result`, `dataset-relative
  wallet tier`, `descriptive timing pattern`, and `predictive timing
  diagnostic`.
- Do not write that Granger tests prove true causality, misconduct, or private
  information.
